## About NodeMCU

NodeMCU is an open-source platform that enables users to create IoT applications. NodeMCU devices are based on the ESP8266 chip, which includes a WiFi module that can be used to connect to a network. NodeMCU devices are popular because they are easy to use and have a low cost.

## Applications of NodeMCU

1. IoT applications
2. Home automation
3. Robotics
4. Wearable technology
5. Smart cars
6. Smart cities
7. Remote monitoring

## Types of NodeMCU

There are two types of NodeMCU boards:

    1. NodeMCU v0.9
    2. NodeMCU v1.0

| Type| Color| Chipset| Pins|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| __NodeMCU v0.9__ | Blue | ESP-12| 16 |
| __NodeMCU v1.0__ | Green | ESP-12E | 22 |

## Software Specifications of NodeMCU

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Programming Languages Used | Lua, C++ Toolchain, Micropython, Arduino Programming Language |
| Popular IDEs | Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, VS Code |

A sample of blinking LED in NodeMCU is shown below in multiple languages:

__Lua__: Programming in Lua for NodeMCU is like Node.js. Lua is asynchronous and event driven.

<MxCodeBlock props={{ language: 'lua', filename: 'main.lua' }}>
  {`-- LED blink --

local pin = 4 -- D4
local delay = 500 -- 500 ms
local status = gpio.LOW

-- initializa pin --
gpio.mode(pin, gpio.OUTPUT)
gpio.write(pin, status)

-- led blink --
tmr.alarm(0, delay, 1, function ()
 if status == gpio.LOW then
     status = gpio.HIGH
    else
     status = gpio.LOW
    end

    gpio.write(pin, status)
end)`}
</MxCodeBlock>

__Micropython__: Micropython is a software implementation of __Python3__. It's written on __C__ and optimized to run on a microcontroller.

<MxCodeBlock props={{ language: 'python', filename: 'main.py' }}>
  {`import mchine
import time

pin = 4
led = machine.Pin(4, machine.Pin.OUT)

while True:
  led.high()
  time.sleed(0.5)
  led.low()
  time.sleep(0.5)`}
</MxCodeBlock>

__.ino__: Arduino Programming Language: It's similar to __C++__.

<MxCodeBlock props={{ language: 'cpp', filename: 'main.ino' }}>
  {`const int LED_PIN = 4;
const int LED_DELAY = 500;  // 500ms

void setup() {
 pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
 digitalWrite(LED_PIN, 1);
    delay(LED_DELAY);
 digitalWrite(LED_PIN, 0);
    delay(LED_DELAY);
}`}
</MxCodeBlock>

## NodeMCU Setup (in Arduino IDE)

Arduino IDE is an open-source IDE developed by Arduino. The Arduino IDE can be used to write programs for lots of microcontrollers including Arduino Boards, ESP8266, ESP32, Adafruit Boards, and Pi Pico Boards.

The setup process of Arduino IDE for NodeMCU is described in the following article ðŸ‘‰ [How to Setup Arduino IDE for NodeMCU?](https://tasnimzotder.com/blog/how-to-set-up-arduino-ide-for-nodemcu).

## Comparison Between NodeMCU and Arduino UNO

Although both NodeMCU and Arduino UNO can be used in IoT development, they have lots of differences. Some of their similarities and differences are as following:

### Similarities between NodeMCU and Arduino UNO

There are a few similarities between the NodeMCU and Arduino Uno. Both boards use a microcontroller, which is a programmable chip that can be used to control electronic devices. They also both use the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for programming. The Arduino Uno has a few more capabilities than the NodeMCU, such as the ability to use shields, which are add-on boards that can provide additional functions, such as motor control or wireless communication. The Arduino Uno also has more input and output pins than the NodeMCU.

### Differences between NodeMCU and Arduino UNO

| Field | NodeMCU | Arduino UNO |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creator | Espressif | Arduino |
| Microcontroller | ESP8266 | ATmega328p |
| Processor | 32-bit | 8-bit |
| Processor Speed | 80MHz | 16MHz |
| SRAM | 64KB | 2KB |
| Flash Memory | 4MB | 32KB |
| Input Voltage | 7-12V | 7-12V |
| Operating Voltage | 3.3V | 5V |
| GPIO Pins | 16 | 14 |
| PWM Pins | 4 | 6 |
| Analog Input (ADC) Pins | 1 | 1 |
| Wireless Communication | ESP8266 SoC | None |
| Serial Communication | UART/I2C/SPI | UART/I2C/SPI |
