## Steps to Set up Arduino IDE for NodeMCU

### 1. Download Arduino IDE

Arduino IDE is a open-source tool for programming microcontrollers like Arduino, NodeMCU, ESP8266, etc. Arduino IDE is available for Windows, Mac, Linux. You can download it from üëâ [Software | Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### 2. Add NodeMCU's URL to Arduino IDE

To add NodeMCU's URL to Arduino IDE, you need to follow the steps below.

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to `File --> Preferences`.
3. In the "Additional Boards Manager" section, add the following link:

<MxCodeBlock props={{ language: 'bash', filename: 'terminal' }}>
  {`http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`}
</MxCodeBlock>

### 3. Add the NodeMCU Board to Arduino IDE

To add the NodeMCU Board to Arduino IDE, you need to follow the steps below.

1. In the Arduino IDE, go to `Tools --> Board: "---" --> Boards Manager`.
2. Search for `esp8266`.
3. Install the "esp8266" board by "ESP8266 Community". It might take a while to install.

### 4. Select the NodeMCU Board

To select the board's port, you need to follow the steps below.

1. Connect the NodeMCU to your computer via USB.
2. In the Arduino IDE, go to `Tools --> Port` and select the port that NodeMCU is connected to.

To select the board, you need to follow the steps below.

1. In the Arduino IDE, go to `Tools --> Board --> ESP8266 Boards`.
2. Select the board that NodeMCU is connected to. For example, `NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)`.

### 5. Write a Sketch

Like Arduino, sketches for NodeMCU are written in `C` or `C++` and are compiled to `.ino` files. A sample sketch for blinking an LED is shown below.

<MxCodeBlock props={{ language: 'cpp', filename: 'main.ino' }}>
  {`void setup() {
 pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); // initialize the LED_BUILTIN as OUTPUT pin
}

void loop() {
 digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0); // Turn on the LED (for LED_BUILTIN, in turns ON on low voltage)
    delay(1000); // wait for 1000 ms
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);
    delay(500);
}`}
</MxCodeBlock>

### 6. Upload the Sketch to NodeMCU

To upload the sketch to NodeMCU, you need to follow the steps below.

1. In the Arduino IDE, click on the ‚úÖ (checkmark) icon in the top to verify that the sketch is correct.
2. Click on the ‚û°Ô∏è (right arrow) icon in the top to upload the sketch to NodeMCU.
3. The sketch will be uploaded to NodeMCU and the LED will blink.
