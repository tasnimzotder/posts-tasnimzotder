Fritzing is an open-source software to design circuits, PCB, and write code for Arduino devices. Fritzing provides components from a variety of designers and producers. Besides, one can use any custom components by adding the part file which has a file extension `fzpz`. In this post, we'll learn how to design circuits with NodeMCU in Fritzing.

### Components & Services

- [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/)
- NodeMCU Part File (`.fzpz`)

## Steps to Design Circuit with NodeMCU in Fritzing

### 1. Download Fritzing Software

1. To download Fritzing, visit [Fritzing.org](https://fritzing.org/download/). But, if you want save money, you can download it from a third-party website [Filehorse](https://www.filehorse.com/download-fritzing-64/).
2. After downloading, move the zip file to a directory where you want to install Fritzing.
3. Unzip the zip file.
4. In the unzipped directory, there is a file named `Fritzing.exe`. Make a shortcut to the `Fritzing.exe` file in your desktop (optional).

### 2. Add NodeMCU Part File to Fritzing

To add the NodeMCU part file to Fritzing, do the following:

1. Download the NodeMCU part file [NodeMCU v1.0](https://github.com/squix78/esp8266-fritzing-parts/blob/master/nodemcu-v1.0/NodeMCUV1.0.fzpz).
2. Open the Fritzing software.
3. To add the part file, go to `File --> Open...` and select the `NodeMCU---.fzpz` part file.
4. The part file will be added to the library.
5. To add NodeMCU to the library, `right-click` on the part file and select `Add to bin... --> My Parts`.

### 3. Design Circuit with NodeMCU in Fritzing

To design a circuit with NodeMCU in Fritzing, do the following:

1. Open the Fritzing software.
2. Add NodeMCU by searching it in the Parts section.

### 4. Export the Circuit Design

To export the circuit design, do the following:

1. In the Fritzing software, go to `File --> Export --> as Image --> PNG/JPG/SVG/PDF`.
